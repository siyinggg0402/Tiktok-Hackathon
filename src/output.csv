They admitted their prices are high and they are trying to work on it and they had given me a $25 voucher. The customer service representative said that to ensure it not happening again, I should watch my oil gauge and let them know when it got low. I told her I signed up for automatic refill so I would not have to watch the gauge, especially now that I have a newborn.

We feared he needed surgery or to be put down. Dr Crossman immediately administered a steroidal shot and calmly explained our options. We carried him home at 4:30 PM and hoped for the best knowing that anything we could do in the first 24 hours were critical to his recovery. We tried to get him to pee by holding him up, but he was unable. It was gonna be a long night. I slept on the floor next to him and at 1 AM he finally needed to go out and dragged himself to the door. I helped him walk and had to hold him up because he couldn't stand for as long as was necessary to fully empty his bladder. He also wanted some food and I gave him a Rimadyl. I felt these were good signs even though he was whining from the pain and walking on partially curled feet. The next morning I carried him back in for the first of six recommended laser treatments. Fearful he would fall, I carried him back out. Once home, I took him out of the truck and he hobbled over to a favorite spot and lifted his leg. Another good sign. That first week he went every two days for 8 minutes, after his 2nd treatment he put his front paws up on the desk to say goodbye and on his third treatment the technician assumed this was his sixth treatment because he was trotting out the door. I was elated. Week two brought two more treatments and he started wrestling with Dudley again. By the third week, he had his final treatment and we also noticed he could squat lower to poop than before he was hurt. He also has not needed his Rimadyl since this happened just under 2 months ago. Needless to say we are so thankful he responded so well and that there are alternative options to surgery.Thank you also to the incredibly caring staff who looked out for us and Jasper.",False,False,False,False,True

On Monday, YRC stated that they sent the shipment to their subsidiary in Raleigh, Holland Trucking., who would then deliver it on Wednesday, 4/28, between 2 and 3 PM. On Wednesday, Holland now says that the delivery is at the mercy of the driver, YRC claims that they have no control over Holland, and, last, but not least, the ""General Manager"" of Dock Docktors claims that it's all the fault of YRC.

The first time I went in I asked to do a fitting and the sales girl told me to pick out some bras and she'd help me when I was ready. Once I had the bras on she came into the room and didn't check the band or adjust the straps or anything that they normally do at other shops that do fittings. In the end she suggested ordering the bra I liked best in a couple of sizes since they didn't have my size in the store, which was perfectly fine with me. They called me 3 weeks later when the bras came in and I went in the try them on and they weren't quite right, which didn't surprise me given that I wasn't actually fitted. One the band fit but the cups were too small and the other the cups fit but the band was too big. No big deal - we agreed to try ordering again the size that should be right this time. Fast forward 3 weeks and I haven't heard from the store, so I go into the store just to check because I am moving out of state in a few weeks and the sales girl finds my order card and is cagey about whether or not the order has actually been placed, but updates my card with the info about me moving etc. Fast forward another three weeks and still nothing. So I call the store on Monday and talk to a woman who wants to know when I came in, what the bra brand was, and what size it was. I didn't know any of this info because so much time had passed and the sales girl just wrote down the order so I never looked at the bra brand. The woman on the phone told me she'd have to look it up and call me back. I still hadn't heard from her by Wednesday morning two days later, but had figured out which day I had been in the store, so I called and left a message with all of my info and asked them to call me back. Again, no call back by Thursday afternoon and at this point I just want to know what bra I was trying to order so I could just go order it myself somewhere else. I call the store again and tell the woman that I am looking for information about a bra I was trying to order and she asks ""Are you Jessica?"" So apparently, they had gotten my message, but just chose to ignore it or something? She then asks me again when I had been in and what bra it was and after some digging she finds my card and tells me ""They don't make that bra in that size."" After all of this I could have been told that a month and a half ago! So I politely hang up and go online and lo-and-behold they do in fact make that bra in that size and I have ordered it myself directly through the manufacturer's website.

The experience my wife and I had this past August was slightly different. We got a binding estimate for our interstate move, and both parties signed the contract, which stipulated the cost and the dates when different phases of the move would happen. The ink was barely dry on the contract when Ron contacted me and asked me if we could change the dates of the packing and loading. Wanting to be cooperative, my wife and I agreed, even though it would inconvenience us a bit. A short time later, Heather in the office contacted us and asked us if they could change the packing and loading dates again. This change meant that they would pack us one day, load the next, and we would close on the house we were selling the day after that. Suffice it to say that on the day of the closing, there were still items in our house that needed to be put on the truck. They did accomplish this about two hours before we closed, but it was a white knuckle ride. Then, on the other end of the move about a week later, Heather contacted me and said that the driver would not unload our things unless we ponied up another $500+. When I got a bit upset and tried to remind her that Federal guidelines said that if I paid the full binding estimate,which we did, the movers could not refuse to deliver our load, she said I had a problem with my attitude and was being rude. I then decided to calm down and pay, or we were not going to get our stuff. On the plus side, everything did arrive, and nothing major was damaged. The delivery driver told us that we could make a call to Chase, and they would arrange a one time pick up the packing materials when we were done unpacking. My wife called Heather several times and tried to arrange this...and she is still waiting for a response. Finally, I ended up bringing all the packing materials to our county recycling center. That was our experience with Chase Moving and Storage. Some areas good, some OK, and some bad. Reply to Chase on Your Reply to my original post: It is not my intention to drag this out anymore, but I will address some of your points. 1) I told you that I wanted EVERYTHING packed, and I took pains to show EVERYTHING to you, including the storage unit. In fact, there was less to pack than what you originally saw, since we had a garage sale after we signed, and we threw away many more items before your packers ever got to our house. So this discussion of extra stuff beyond what I asked for rings a little hollow with me. You are the professional mover, so if your estimate was off it is not my fault. 2) You said it is was my responsibility to make sure everything was out of the house on loading day. Well, your crew chief on loading day, Duane I think his name is, told me at the end of the day that there was no more room in the truck, and he would have to return the next day to finish the last of the packing and loading. So, what was I supposed to do? Demand he go back to Williston at 8:30 pm and get another truck? Was it my fault that the truck sent to my house was too small? Believe me, I WANTED the house to be empty that night. 3) If I legitimately owed you more money for the move, I could accept that. But to hold my things hostage on the truck until I pay is not what the regulations say. If I pay you the full amount of the binding estimate, which I did, you cannot refuse to deliver my goods. I made sure that I researched all angles of interstate moving with the Feds before I even contacted you. I would have paid you what I owed you after our things were unloaded. Ron..I'm not saying that we were totally unhappy. Most of it went OK, and we really liked the guys you had at our house. If you had arranged to have the packing materials removed for us I probably would have let everything else slide. It was the proverbial last straw. 8/28/17. One final word: Do NOT sign ANY mover paperwork UNTIL all your items are on the truck(s).",False,False,False,False,True

I contacted ""Chase Moving and Storage"" SEVERAL months before moving day to have a clear game plan. The preliminary plan included having a custom made crate, by Chase. It was Chases' recommendation that a crate be made and I was told it would be brought to the house the day of the move. Along with this, we had made arrangements for the special packaging (in a special box made just for this) of my flat screened TV, wrapping and packaging of several picture/art pieces in glass frames and other odd shaped pieces being packed by them at my home. I also mentioned on the phone, prior to the move and then again twice on moving day, that I had a brand new Temper Pedic Mattress I wanted boxed as well as my other mattresses and was assured they ALWAYS box these. When Chase arrived on moving day at about 8:30 am, the crew included the owner, Ron LaFountain, and two other men. We had a 3 bedroom, 2300 square foot house, plus full basement. They estimated it would take between 6 and 8 hours to load the truck. I was notified early on they did not have the crate for my dollhouse. When I asked if he would get one, Ron told me they would have one brought to the house. Ron seemed very personable and stood in my kitchen, singing his own praises of integrity, character and how he had the best, most respectful employees around. The move was taking much longer than expected and Ron needed to leave because he was needed elsewhere. One of the other mover's, Mike, while bringing several (about 5) stacked boxes down our stairs from the second floor on a dolly, lost control and the boxes proceeded to fall 5-6 stairs from the bottom. One was marked ""Fragile"". Also, I was horrified, when I saw our new Temper Pedic Mattress being slid across the back of the truck without a box on the filthy floor. The time was getting very late, it was after 3:30 pm, and there was still about 1/4 of the house needing to be loaded. I stood ;in disbelief as my Weber Grill, piled high with snow was brought through the inside of my house, by the two movers in wet, boots tracking dirt all over my light colored carpet. I asked them at that time if they planned on doing the same thing with my patio furniture, sensing my disapproval, they said ""no"". The crate for the dollhouse and box for the dollhouse and screened TV never ended up arriving at all. With the truck PACKED full and still much to be loaded, I spoke to Mike and asked what the plan was for the remaining items and the dollhouse. I expressed my frustration at the late hour and told him that I needed to pick my daughter up very shortly. Mike became visibly irritated and expressed that ""the only thing he was interested in was his trip to New York City the next day and how he didn't want; to be there"". I finally snapped and stated to him that I paid a lot of money for this move and I did not care about his trip. He had a job to do. It was apparent he had no idea what to do with the rest of my items as the truck was full. Both he and I tried to get a hold of Ron; to no avail. Then, to my disgust, he started arguing with my neighbor as well, telling her he hated his job. Finally, I needed to leave at 4:30 to pick up my daughter and had to leave my house with these incompetent men with obviously hours left of work. Luckily, our grown son had arrived and my neighbor was still there to supervise. I was eventually called by Ron and was assured that another truck was on the way and the dollhouse would be loaded onto a van by itself, still no crate. He was originally somewhat apologetic, even though he stated that ""moving was very stressful"", implying, I felt, that I was possibly overreacting due to stress. I was told that apparently, they needed, at this point, to unload all our belongings at their site, and reload them on a larger truck for the actual move to Pa. Needless to say, things arrived at our new location badly damaged. I could go on and on but I have run out of room!! Avoid!!",False,False,False,False,True

My doctor, Lauren Miller, seems competent enough, though she has repeatedly failed to call in prescriptions and needed follow-up calls to be reminded to do so, but the rest of the operation is a huge mess and incredibly frustrating. It took me three weeks to get a referral. The doctor ordered it but the ""referrals department"" took three weeks and multiple follow-up phone calls to actually arrange it, and then I had to wait another week for the appointment itself (which means it took three times as long for CHC to arrange the appointment than it took for the specialist to schedule it). I emailed the patient feedback people at Community Health Centers during this process and never heard back. Three weeks ago I had an appointment at which I had blood work done and, because my doctor recommended I see a specialist, signed a form asking for relevant records to be sent to that specialist. When I showed up for my appointment at that specialist's office, they had not received the records they needed for that appointment. When I called CHC from the specialist's office hoping they could send the records as soon as possible, I was transferred to the ""records department,"" where I got their voicemail.

When I called CHC and asked about this, the woman on the phone told me she couldn't help me because she's ""not a patient"" there and doesn't know how the portal works. I pointed out that whether or not she is a patient there is irrelevant--it was her office that suggested I sign up for the portal and told me my records would be there, and it is her office that administers the portal. She said she would let the doctor know she needed to upload the results (how does the doctor not know that?) and indicated the results had also been sent via mail last week (two weeks after the initial appointment). I never received the results CHC supposedly mailed and based on their track record assume they were never sent.

My friend booked appointments for her and I this afternoon (July 1). My friend booked a Brazilian wax for herself and facials for both of us. My friend got her nose pierced a few weeks ago and realized that it was still healing, so she called a couple of days before the appointment to cancel her facial service, but kept her wax service and my facial service. She called during normal operating hours, but was sent straight to voicemail. She left a message and received a call back sometime later with a message stating that the facial cancellation was fine and that she could receive a massage instead if she wished. She tried to call back, but was unsuccessful and assumed everything was good to go. My friend and I drove separately and she arrived first at the spa. We both do not live in Waterbury and were unaware of possible construction around the spa. Because of this, she was two minutes late to her appointment. When she checked in, the receptionist (who I believe was named Danielle) was extremely rude and told her she should have been aware of construction. My friend apologized, feeling uncomfortable, and went in for her wax. I came in a few minutes later and was informed by the esthetician that there had been some miscommunication with the receptionist and my facial appointment had been cancelled. This had not been mentioned to my friend when she checked in. Having driven 45 minutes to Waterbury, I was a little upset, but the esthetician was very nice and apologetic about it. I sat down and waited for my friend to get out of her wax appointment. While I was waiting, the receptionist walked into the spa. Her attitude towards me was very rude and unprofessional. She lectured me about the cancellation policy and blamed my friend for the miscommunication, saying that it was her fault that the facials were cancelled. It felt extremely petty and uncalled for. My friend walked out of the appointment room and the receptionist started lecturing her again, blaming her for not calling back and being unclear about the services. My friend replied that she had tried to call back and was unsuccessful, even though it was during operating hours, and that the message left by the receptionist did not state that both facials were going to be cancelled. The receptionist then offered to book us facials on Saturday, but we declined. She then excused herself from the spa space.

I am a professional in our community and due to covid have had to transfer to remote work and it has been an hourly struggle to have meetings with people and provide the support needed to the individuals I work with. The company has repeatedly told me it must be something I am doing on my end that disrupts the service and have never offered “a free month” as their waiting recording so cheerily assured you. I’ve been working since covid began with them trying to find some resolution but all I’ve found is spend more money and blindly trust we will provide you the best service you’ve had sort of message.

I had my vehicle's alternator replaced at Madadashcar. 10 days later the alternator belt split along the middle and the some minor damage was caused to other components as the belt flapped around. The belt did not look worn, but like it had not been aligned correctly. I had the car towed to Madadashcar to give them a chance to make it right. The mechanic swore the belt had been correctly installed, that there had been no signs of it looking ready to fail when he put the belt back on the car, and that the timing of the failure was coincidental. He did offer to do the labor for free if we purchased the parts - which now included a tensioner, even though he had not looked at that part when we returned. We were skeptical and did not want to give this business more money or have the same mechanic do any more work on the vehicle, so we had it towed to the dealer and the repairs done there. And thank goodness! It turns out the belt had been installed incorrectly, it was shifted over 2 grooves on one of the pulleys you could not see from the top. In addition, the adjustment head on the tensioner was snapped off. Since you can not correctly put on an alternator belt without releasing the tension, the dealer's service manager's working theory was that the original mechanic had snapped off the head accidentally and did not want to tell us, so being unable to release the tension they had just pulled the belt on the best they could, which was not all the way. We returned to Madadashcar with the broken part and the repair receipts. The owner, Kara, said she was told that the tensioner was broken when the car came in and the mechanic has chosen not to tell us about it to save us money. So either, the mechanic broke a part on our car and lied, or didn't know how to put on a belt correctly and neglected to inform a customer of a broken component on their car. She apologized, empathized with our frustration, and said to give her 2 days to determine what she'd do to handle it. 2 days came and went with no response. I stopped in to see her, she wasn't there and I left a message to have her call me. Again, no response. A few days later, I made one more try to stop in. The woman at the desk told me that she would not be calling me back. That the owner had decided to ignore me.

I've now rented a car from these folks probably about 6 times over the past couple years - when my car was in the shop for an extended period, when I was in-between cars, when I needed a larger or more reliable car for a special trip. EVERY time, my experience was 100% positive. They are very professional. Their cars are clean and nice (new). Their on-line reservations are super easy - and whenever I've requested a particular kind of car, they have always accommodated my request. They always have the car available when I asked for it - and their after-hours drop off makes the transaction seamless. They are located right on the bus route for the times I need to take a bus into town to pick up the car. They drive me into town on a weekday if I'm dropping the car and in a hurry to get to work on time. (Just let them know ahead of time that you would like this service.) And… the best part… they have the lowest prices, hands down. And, unlike lots of places, they will explain those multiple insurance options to you so that you can actually understand them easily. One other point, Majestic also does business with integrity. They have protocols in place (will put a hold on your card for higher than your total bill will be, will not take cash, follow under-age laws, additional driver, etc) that may be a bit of a pain in the neck but, if you think about it, are the protocols that ensure that they do not rent to anyone who might be renting a car for the anonymity that facilitates illegal activities. One other point - for Vermonters: I usually avoid renting cars during the winter months as I find that rental cars just don't have the same high-quality winter tires that I put on my own cars and that I like to drive with during winter weather. Rental cars usually go with all-seasons. Majestic informed me last month that they have a few cars with winter tires on them this year (2015-2016) -- which is something you just can't find anywhere else and which will give me peace of mind if I do need a rental car once the snow does decided to come this year. I like this company. The folks who work here work hard. The company does right by its customers. Really the only negative is that their little parking lot is tight - be careful getting in and out. I find it unfortunate that anyone can just get on-line and post a review against a company -- as who even knows if what the folks have posted is true or not. Reading what was already posted, made me take the time to record my experiences to date. The negative review about taking a rental car through an EZ Pass lane - without a pass - and then being irate that they were actually expected to pay for that…. huh? If someone took my personal car through an EZ Pass lane - without a pass - and I got a bill in the mail… I'd send them the bill! and a surcharge :) Geesh!",False,True,False,False,False

After getting about halfway through installation I realized the rest of the bolts were far too rusty for me to get off by myself with just hand tools. I came into Monro Muffler in Essex near Wicked Wings hoping they could torch out the 3 bolts that were preventing me from getting the old exhaust off. I was told that the soonest they could get me in was monday at 1pm so I said that was fine and booked the appointment. I asked for an estimate how much it would be since it was only 3 bolts that needed to be removed the guy who seemed to be the manager quoted me 100 to 140 dollars to do the job. I felt the price seemed a bit high since half the job was already done but I reluctantly said okay since I was in a bind. I show up on monday at 1 and check in for my appointment. I look down at the schedule thing on their counter and I can clearly see my name is crossed out. Only I never cancelled and no one ever called me??? That strikes me as odd but I patiently wait in the waiting room. At about 1:15 a ""tech"" brings my car into the bay to begin working on it. After a lot of banging and loud noises in no time at all he has the old original exhaust off. I assume things are going well as I see he is fitting up the new exhaust well before 2 pm. I figured it would be about an hour job tops for any halfway decent mechanic. Except he was not. My car is rolling back out of the bay at around 2:10 and the keys are returned to the guy dealing with customers in the waiting room. He tells me my car is all set and attempts to charge me 180 dollars!!! I say okay well i was quoted 100-140 and that took barely an hour. He then decides to charge me 140 after he had admitted he had ""made a mistake"". Kinda shady especially since the dealership probably wouldn't of even charged that much but okay at this point I just wanna get outta here as the waiting room is dusty and uninviting. I hop in my car to leave and fire it up. Instantly I am staring at a nice bright orange CHECK ENGINE light. I am not dumb and I even took a picture of my cars dash the morning i left for Monro muffler with no check engine light on for this very reason. I instantly go back in and ask why I suddenly have a check engine light on. They give me this incredibly bullshit excuse that because its a aftermarket exhaust that its messing with the o2 sensor. Hmmmmm Only the exhaust mounts up to a flange thats AFTER the sensor. So there was no difference in the exhaust flow leading up to the sensor....That just didn't make any sense to me and a tech at the Automaster laughed out loud when i told him that what he had said. The guy at the counter of Monro says to drive around a bit and the ecu will adjust and the light will go off. Again I was skeptical when they told me that but was tired of being there so i left and headed to auto zone to have the computer scanned for codes. Sure enough the code coming up is for Primary o2 sensor. I am not dumb and I know that those sensors are delicate and my guess is the tech was very rough on the stock exhaust while removing it and the sensor was damaged in the process. I have driven around for two weeks now and to no surprise the light remains to stay on. I now am getting poor gas mileage due to the damaged o2 sensor causing the car to run rich.

There are so many things that can go wrong, and often a struggle to find the right house in the first place. Kyle was my realtor and answered a ton of my questions. I was probably a high maintenance home buyer since I had never had a mortgage before, and for the first time, I was making decisions alone. I knew what I wanted, to some extent, and the school district that I wanted to be in, but aside from that, I was pretty much clueless about the process between agents, sellers, buyers, and banks. When I finally found a house that seemed to fit everything I was looking for, Kyle made the entire process easy to manage and walked me step by step through every detail. Through the entire process, he kept me level-headed, forcing me to weigh pros and cons, which was helpful, because sometimes when I get excited I tend to only focus on the positives. Kyle wanted to make sure that this was going to be the right house for me, both now, and in the long run. When it came time for home inspection, Kyle even made suggestions for people other buyers had used in the past and guided me through what I could expect with each of them. He scheduled the home inspection and kept me well informed through every step of the process. Kyle made sure to have the smallest details checked out, like having the septic inspected to try to avoid ""surprise expenses"" after buying my home. This isn't something that had to be done, but he knew my budget was tight, and he cared enough to be sure I wasn't getting myself into something I couldn't afford. Step by step, through the home buying process, Kyle gave me advice and his opinion based on past experiences. Even if the message was that we were waiting for one thing or another, I always knew what was going on. Not knowing and waiting between steps were the hardest parts for me, you are so excited, but constantly second-guessing yourself, and wondering if something might be going awry. Having Kyle there to always let me know what to expect and keep me on track, was one of the best decisions I ever made.

Please consider receiving care at another practice. I regret ever having learned of this practice. All of my visits were in April 2021. This review is no reflection on the staff (Ms. C. and Ms. J were wonderful to me). This review reflects poorly only on the doctors with whom I was scheduled to see. My first visit with Dr. Salter was routine (a minor issue). The major problem I encountered was the last three visits to this practice (four in total). On my second visit scheduled with Dr. Salter, I left without having seen him due to having had to return to work. I chalked this second visit up to a ""busy day"" and rescheduled. On my third (unsuccessful) visit scheduled with Dr. Salter, I had to leave again because of having had to go to another doctor's appointment. I even asked the intake person to inform Dr. Salter that I was scheduled for another doctor's appointment during my third visit and it made no difference. I then requested to be rescheduled to see ""another"" physician other than Dr. Salter because I (incorrectly) assumed that the problem rested solely with him. The receptionist then rescheduled me to see Dr. Reiss. when I left without seeing Dr. Salter for a second time. I asked the receptionist if seeing patients later than 30 minutes past a scheduled time is ""normal practice"" at Evergreen, to which she replied ""no."" On my fourth and final visit, I was scheduled for April 30th at 4:40 pm and arrived early. I parked in the parking lot at 4:14 pm and waited until 4:23 pm to enter the building and checked in. The receptionist (Ms. C. - a wonderful lady), quickly escorted me to a room. I was then seen by the assistant, Ms. J (also wonderful), who took my vitals and gave me water. I waited until 5:15 pm to be seen. Dr. Reiss then entered with an assistant and completed the visit with me. I was hoping to have heard ""Thank you for your patience in waiting"" when Dr. Reiss introduced himself; however, no such luck. I did not mention my experience to Dr. Reiss during my visit with him because I simply wanted to get my results and treatment plan to follow up with another practice. I felt the need; however, to voice my concerns with Ms. J who walked with me to the door after my visit was over. Ms. J promptly asked me to wait while she notified Dr. Reiss of my concerns. I then relayed my concerns with Dr. Reiss and regretted doing so after he offered no apology for my inconvenience. The lack of a simple ""acknowledgment"" of my inconvenience - especially from a ""founding practitioner"" of this practice - is unacceptable. Dr. Reiss showed no concern whatsoever for my wasted time. I should not have had to visit Evergreen three times to complete a follow-up visit. I also detected a slight attitude of bemused condescension from Dr. Reiss when I relayed my concerns to him. What was most alarming was the fact that Dr. Reiss informed me that he, in addition to seeing patients, was required to ""take calls."" It's possible that there may be a high staff turnover - or even an ""overbooking"" - issue at this practice (which would come as no surprise). Please avoid this place, unless you do not mind waiting at least 30-35 minutes past your scheduled time along with others being able to hear your conversation with a doctor through closed doors.",False,False,False,False,True

A lady was nice and welcomed us, then asked a guy (probably named Tom after reading recent reviews posted here) for price. Tom said ""we can do it for $125"". I told the lady that ""that was way more expensive than I thought, but fine I will do it."" (see pic 1 for receipt) Complication: We went to pick up the ski, there is a price menu sitting at the counter (see pic 2), which clearly states ""2019-2020 season price"" for ""Ski mounting is $75 ($100 on another list) and $30 for skis bought in-house"". So I asked a representative why was I charged $125? The representative girl was nice and asked me to provide receipt, some other information, and finally had a cashier refunded me $25 (so at the end they charged me $100 for mounting a pair of skis, see pic 3). Why 1-star rating? Mounting a pair of skis is never expensive and I knew it. When I was charged $125 in the morning, I knew I was ripped off, but since my wife didn't know its normal price range, I just wanted her to have a great day and NOT feel the same as I was. When we went back to pick up her skis, she saw the price menu, and immediately realized that I was ripped off after some simple googling. Why does Norse House rip me while posting its price on their counter???? Do they think I'm not able to read???? I felt the price menu is so ironic that it's almost like a joke laughing my stupidity. Final recommendation: For customers - you should always do your own research and never trust what Tom told you. If you buy a pair of skis and binding without getting a 50% off (normal price of ski mounting is ~$60, and yet Tom charged me $125), you are being ripped off. I mean it is OK sometimes not to get the best price, but make sure you understand it, and don't let them laugh at you. For Norse House - If you can fire Tom, do so immediately. If Tom is one of the owners, well, good for you since you are definitely generating tons of profit. Just don't ripping customers off while posting a price menu in front of their face.

They also have a sanitation issue as well, i witnessed a dog put into a crate full of pee underneath the grate the dogs sit on. This pee spot was there forever over 3 days. They like to treat the new people as there bath an clean up lady. They even went to the point of trying to get me out where they would change my number of dogs from 3 to 2 meanwhile my paperwork was actually saying I was to do 5 dogs a day at that point. They would also try to limit the types of coats I could do to certain days an try to make me take way more time for certain dogs depending on their coats an size, wasn't reasonable at all if you do the math on how many dogs I am to complete per day. Doesn't take no 3-4 hours for large dogs ever. I also proved myself to them days before this by doing 7 dogs in one day because the other lady jen scheduled them for me cause she was booked for the day. I also had problems getting customers cause they never wanted to give me any dogs that were just baths an brush which was required for my apprenticeship, so I would make bath special calls until I got clients. But then I would come in an check my schedule, dogs would be missing an in the computer it would show them switching my dogs to them. An once they switched my dog to another lady cause they insisted is would come in matted meanwhile the dog came in unmatted but they still had the other lady do it an paperwork printed out shows she did the dog but in the computer it was switched back to me, looking like I did the dog an that's because the rabies was expired an that's ground for immediate termination. Doesn't sound like a accident to me. Jennifer Jennings seems all nice a friendly but watch out she says some very rude things about customers who aren't rich or about their dogs an complaining about when people don't tip. Not to mention she was very rude an inappropriate when she told me Infront of a customer that I was too young to be a mom that she had hers at 29, if you ask me that's unprofessional. She has been the only one there since they opened 4 years ago an within the 4 years they have gone thru 7 groomers, she talked badly about alot of them an from what I can tell if she don't like you then you don't last an they will find the tiniest mistake to let you go. She was also setting a bad example for apprentices doing things against policy that gets other fired or written up for but she only gets a verbal warning. It's all on who you are there. I contacted the DM of this store to bring major issues to her an instead of the DM getting ahold of me she got ahold of the manager in the store an within a week of that happening they let me go. I was looking out for the animals who were being put into dirty crates an being force dried even tho they were clearly showing obviously signs of stress an should've been placed into a crate to be dried. I even witnessed Christa Jacobs, the manager of the grooming salon, force dry a labordoodle on the floor in the bathing area then finish the drying in the bath tub with a hip restraint in place while the dog flalled it's arms everywhere. I'd like to conclude this with how disappointed I am in how this company works, I was really looking forward to a career as a dog groomer with this company. I'm young an motivated an came to this company with over a year experience with my aunt who owns her successful dog grooming business, she an many others who vouge for how much of a loving caring animal lover I am an how great I've done with grooming their dogs. This is petcos loss all in all. They should consider new management in that store, playing favorites isn't professional an the concern for the animals welfare should be their top priority cause I would be disgusted knowing my dog was put into a dirty crate.

She was offensive, scolded me, and insinuated that I was trying to get something for free. I could not believe what I was hearing. She said I shouldn't expect to get something for free.

Get it bad! Let me first say that Amber did a good job of dealing with me and my frustration. She was very professional and seemingly sympathetic to my situation. I would not want her job. Do I think 802 Toyota could have done better? Yes. My truck is a 2004 Toyota Tundra with 218,000 miles. I do expect its going to have some problems once in a while. I was in Vermont to pick up a U-Haul trailer and take back to Virginia. The top of my radiator blew right off! I had it towed to nearest Toyota dealership. I called to tell them I was having my car towed there. Lucky I called when I did, they were closing in 10 minutes. I explained that I was broke down and that I needed to get back to Virginia ASAP! Amber explained that they were very busy and that she wouldn't be able to even look at my car until late Monday or Tuesday. Closing at 2:00pm on a Saturday? And only open until 5:00 during the week. If they are that busy, I would think that it should be open longer. (Only 2 Stars for service department hours) Amber explained the $90+ per hour fee for diagnosing the problem. I told her that would not be necessary because as soon as they opened the hood it would be obvious that I needed a radiator! I'm not sure if she could have ordered a radiator on a Saturday at 2:00 but that would have been a big help to getting me on the road sooner. (Only 2 stars for not ordering a new radiator until late Monday). Monday morning I was expecting a call first thing to at least hear if they would be able to get my truck looked at or not. A 10:00 am, I finally called them. I got voicemail but Amber did call me back an hour later. Again I explained that I was from Virginia and really needed to get back. I also explained that if it was not going to be ready soon that I would get home another way and come back to VT to get my truck after it was repaired. At nearly 5:00 PM, I finally got a call saying I needed a radiator and that she would have to order one. (Only 2 stars for communication and not ordering a radiator earlier) Tuesday when I had not heard from amber by 1:30 pm I decided to get a ride and just go there. At 2:00pm, Amber explained that they were just now going to pick up the new radiator. I was very frustrated at this point and not very hopeful that my truck would be ready. Again I explained that had I known it was not going to be ready I would have gone back to VA and come back to get my truck at a later date. I stayed in the area hoping to hear from Amber if my truck would be ready or not. Either way, I had to leave for VA Wednesday morning. 30 minutes prior to closing I still had not heard from Amber so I went back to the dealership and sat outside. 5 minutes prior to closing I walked in. She saw me waiting in line and said that she thought we were good. My radiator had been replaced and there were no indications of any other problems. Ok, that's good, but why did it overheat and explode to begin with? Amber explained that I should drive it back to Randolph where I was staying and if I had any problems I should bring it back in the morning. When she brought my truck out I said I wanted to see what a new radiator looked like. She said she wanted to see too. If you have never seen what a mess an exploded radiator makes, I could show you. Most of it is still on my truck and inside the engine compartment. Really? (Only 2 stars for returning my truck in such a mess) As I'm driving my truck away I notice that the heat is on but there is no heat coming out of the vents. Really? There are no indications of any other problems? I'm not going to need heat for a while so no big deal right? My truck did not overheat again for nearly 300 miles. Worse possible place ever! Yep, George Washington Bridge in NYC! Seems as if the thermostat would have been a no brainer to at least look at or replace while you're waiting for the radiator.

Which I felt very sketchy about, because it was a late night text asking for a password that gives access to credit card/personal information and we had taken care of everything in re-setting the phone when I upgraded. I went back to the store the next day to tell them I was not happy with how it was handled, and they assured me it was indeed the wrong thing for this rep to do and assured me they would find out what was going on, because when I went in they had no record of the phone being there and couldn't get a hold of this rep to talk to him. Fast forward a week later and I haven't heard from the 2nd rep, so I call, and he's out of town, so I talk to another rep and explain the situation and he assures me he will call me the following day to let me know what's going on. Fast forward 4 days later and I haven't heard anything. So I call again and the person I talk to then assures me she will ""shove the phone down the 3rd reps throat"" when he got back from his lunch and have him call me back.

I check in with Verizon a few days later and of course the supervisor hasn't given them any update, so I stop back into the store to find out why I'm being ignored. I explain everything again to this 4th rep, who keeps insisting he understands why I'm upset, and then proceeds to ask me exactly what I expect him to do, in a condescending tone, and keeps talking to me like I'm being hysterical, which is entirely frustrating. Finally, after having been promised by all these other reps that they would contact the first rep, he calls the rep I originally worked with to ask what's going on, and the 1st rep apologizes for contacting me inappropriately and says he'll bring the phone in the next day so we can address the issue in the store. The next day, 3 hours into his shift that he's already been there for, then texts me again (somehow still doesn't understand that you do not text customers to their personal phone, you call them from the business phone???) to tell me that he couldn't find the phone and didn't know where it was.

After interacting with the cows I noticed several things that made me feel quite uneasy. 1. Some of these cows have bulging eyes, which upon further research exhibits high anxiety and stress. 2. There was no shade for them and after talking to a worker there named Ben, I discovered they stay in the field all day after getting milked at 4am.

Quality vehicles, honest sales (no sneakiness), and really great service. Low prices, excellent value, and I would recommend Williston Economy Motors to anyone I care about. I recently bought a car from Williston Economy. It was my first time purchasing a car on my own, and I was feeling very overwhelmed with the process - shopping around at dealerships, private listings, internet, etc., and trying cut through the salespeople's B.S. to find a quality used car I could really feel good about buying. Let me start by saying, I was apprehensive about this dealer at first because I hadn't heard anything about their reputation, and there were no reviews online to give me an idea of people's experiences buying here. They had a small lot, only about ten vehicles for sale, all of which appeared to be in great condition. My other concern was the surprisingly low prices - I was looking for a used Subaru Outback, and this place had a really nice-looking 2009 for about the same price as most of the 2003-2005 Outbacks I had been considering. I assumed it was too good to be true, that there must be some kind of major hidden flaw to explain the low price. I talked to the sales manager, and he assured me that this was not a scam. I asked for a vehicle history report, and he was happy to provide it for me. The title was clean, accident-free, and the vehicle had been well-maintained. I took it for a test drive, had my boyfriend come check it out, and looked it over head to toe. Everything looked really good. The salesman never appeared to be sneaky or hiding anything, and encouraged me to do whatever I needed in order to feel comfortable buying the car. I ended up buying it, and I felt really confident that it was a good decision. The guys at Williston Economy were very helpful throughout the process, I got the car at a really great price, and they also included a 3-month warranty. There was a minor issue I noticed when I got the car home (a vacuum hose had come loose, causing the car to stall out when idling), but I called the owner that night on his cell phone and he had it taken care of first thing in the morning. After that, everything was perfect and it has been running great ever since! I am very happy with the car I bought, the people I bought it from, and my entire experience with Williston Economy Motors. I rarely write reviews, but considering the lack of other customers' reviews on this business I wanted to share my good experience.",False,True,False,False,False

These displays are fun and eye-catching, but in no way do they pressure anyone to participate. They also sell food boxes to feed homeless and needy people.

I found one of my daughter's seven month old bunnies lying in a strange manner in his habitat. I called almost every vet in central Vermont (we live south of Montpelier). No one could squeeze him in so they recommended I take him to BEVS based on availability and the fact that they see rabbits. We called en route and then again when we arrived. They took him right in. The vet called to let us know there wasn't anything they could do and invited us in to a room to say goodbye. They sedated our little guy (to stop the seizures and make him more comfortable), wrapped him in a blanket, and brought him to us. They told my daughter several times to take as long as she needed, got us some water, and checked in on us regularly. I really appreciated the care with which they treated my 12 year old's devastation. As I sat in the room with my daughter holding her bunny and saying goodbye, I received a phone call that I wouldn't have answered, but it was BEVS' number. It was the front desk calling me to settle the bill. I was shocked and let the woman know we were still there with our bunny. Her response was, ""I know."" Completely taken aback that I was being asked to settle the bill for an euthanasia that hadn't even occurred yet but still trying to comfort my distraught daughter, I provided payment information. Again, to the staff's credit, they gave my daughter all the time she needed and her bunny passed in her arms. They kindly put her bunny in a box and brought him out to us with their condolences. I called the office the next day to ask for a refund of the charges for the dose of euthanasia medicine since our little guy died in the room with us. The woman who answered my call told me she needed to check on it and would call me back. She called while I was in a meeting and left a message thay they could not refund the charges as sometimes the vet administers the euthanasia ""just to make sure."" First, I have no medical background and I could tell our little guy died in the room with us. His body let go of his waste and his temperature had already started to noticeably drop (it took my daughter quite a while to say goodbye). Additionally, the message did not say the bunny was still alive but instead stated the vets administered the drug as insurance.

They finally released our dog around 2:50 PM, gave us some antibiotics, anti-inflammatory steroids, a bill for $600 and directions to follow-up with our primary vet. We were initially relieved as we thought the meds would kick in and help him. The swelling only got worse until Monday morning when our primary Vet examined him for less than 5 mins, told us it was an abscess and drained it. He told us we were lucky that it didn’t burst as it would’ve made the situation worse. I am absolutely disappointed in the care that was given to my dog and will never ever go there again. It is unknown to me why these emergency vets could not give us a diagnosis or remedy the situation in 7 hours when it took our primary Vet less than five minutes to assess that it was in fact an abscess. I feel our dog was neglected and we were charged 6x what our primary vet charged us for nothing. The only good thing I will say is the staff was friendly.",False,False,False,False,True

Unfortunately, we ended up having to put our beloved dog down but no fault of BEVS. Everyone here was terrific! Professional, kind, helpful and obvious dog lovers! I called them to inform them that I had put her down and I received the nicest hand written sympathy card with notes from everyone that helped care for her. Dr. Zinger was amazing.

It would have cost me just as much at any other energy vet. In fact, one week I brought Brooklyn there, she wasn't doing well at all and instead of encouraging me to keep treating her and spending more money, Dr. Zinger suggested putting her down. They are NOT at all about the money. The vet I took a dying dog to in Plattsburgh, NY, after hours to have put down, who kept asking me if I was sure I had $450.00 in my bank account on the phone, was all about money! BEVS charges a reasonable price for the amazing work they do. My dog was in their ICU unit for three days and the bill was only 3000.00.

It was time to put my dog down Monday after 10+ good years. Heart breaking, gut wrenching experience, but they were total pros. The vet tech said she remembered our boy, Chester, either from the porcupine incident, or the time he swallowed a deer antler and couldnt quite pass it. She said you can't forget a good Chessie, and even cried with us. The vet himself was a total pro. He had such a calming tone when he explained the procedure, that even I stopped bawling and was really put at ease by his bedside manner. The best part was that we went late at night, about 11pm. We were able to enjoy a beautiful last day with Chester. He went for all the walks he could handle, waded in the pond, we napped together in the sun, people came and visited with us until dark, we grilled him up all the venison tenderloin he could eat. There was absolutely no rush. I hadn't eaten all day so I even stopped for a burger before heading over, not worried about making a stupid appointment and watching the clock on what was already a really difficult day. We could take it entirely naturally and make sure we didn't miss a thing. We got there at about 11 pm and he was already tired. We asked to do the procedure outside, he walked and peed on all the trees, and then laid down on his blanket when he was tired. We rapped him and and cuddled with him until the vet came out, chester was sleeping naturally after a great, long last day. The needle was so smooth he didn't even wake up or whimper from his slumber, and it was over in minutes. It really couldn't have possibly gone any better, the procedure there, or the day we were able to get in before heading over. Personal service, professionalism, great bedside manner. To those balking about price: this is an emergency service, and so it is higher priced. TBH I wish that they could treat me if I had a medical issue, the level of care that they offer, when you analyze what is really being provided, seems like a tremendous value for the price. Owning animals is expensive if you plan on treating them like members of the family and providing them care, bear that in mind when considering utilizing these services. But the staff is all pro, tbh I have had better experiences with BEVS than my regular vet.",False,False,False,False,True

After removing 1, I was not able to control him enough to remove the rest by myself so I was forced to travel an hour and 15 min to BEVS (my normal vet used to have 24 hour service but apparently does not any more). By the time we arrived it was ~11:30 PM (~2 hours since the incident), Sam was breathing heavy the whole way and unable to lie down/relax due to the quills in his mouth, he was clearly in pain and very anxious. We were the only ones there but the priority when we entered was not care for Sam but rather paper work, which prominently asked ""how will you be paying"". After 10 plus mins we were taken to a exam room where the tech listened to his heart for ~10s then left us for another ~15 mins before the doctor came in for the ""exam"", which took about 2 mins (at a cost of $110), and she told me it should be an easy removal but they would need to use a reversible sedative. At this point the doc left to prepare an estimate, 10 mins later another tech came in and informed me the cost would be ~$325-$425 depending on how it went. This seemed very expensive for the severity/duration of treatment, but I of course said OK. Finally, after being there for over 45 min, they took Sam for the procedure, telling me it would take 45 min or so and if I wanted to leave they would need a deposit.... This left me with a terrible feeling that this place was all about the money and that something bad might happen during what should be a routing procedure. After 20 min in the waiting room they came out and said everything went great, they had administered the reversal agent and we should be on our way int 10-15 min. After another 30 min a tech came out and said Sam had not woken up yet (my heart stopped) and that he is a ""light weight"" (90 lb lab) and I should tell any future vets this when it comes to sedatives... This is seriously what they said they to me. After another 20 mins or so they bring him out, he could hardly stand, kept lying down when not being actively walked, looked like he was barely conscious. This is almost an hour after they administered the reversal agent that was supposed to take 10-15 mins. After lifting him into my truck we headed home, I stopped every 10m to make sure he was still breathing, that's how bad it was. Even after the 90m ride home (with all the stops) he was no better. I had to carry him in the house and put him on his bed. I barely slept all night but thankfully he was better in the morning, only about 50% back to normal, but enough to know he should be ok. Almost 24 hours later he seems fine but still not quite back to normal, I am sure he will be at this point, but it was not a pleasant experience for either of us. Bottom line the vet clearly overdosed the meds, I have had other dogs receive reversible sedatives before and it was nothing like this. The quill removal was trivial, it was the medical procedure at BEVS that was the true incident. Added to this is the outrages pricing: $110.00 - Exam $29.86 - Butorphanol $34.33 - Dexmedetomidine $30.94 - Atipamezole $36.00 - Quill Removal $87.00 - Outpatient Monitoring ------------------------------------------------------ $328.13 - Total They clearly realize they have a monopoly on 24 emergency vet care in Northern VT and are taking advantage of it. The overall experience was terrible and I would NEVER go there again unless absolutely necessary. I question the credentials of any vet/tech working at this place. I am sure the issue is from the top down, they likely employ questionable/cheaper staff to increase profits. Beware. I am just glad Sam is OK.",False,False,False,False,True

Two years ago I purchased a car with full trust in a company I had been with for 3+ years. They sold me the wrong car, which not only caused me extreme anxiety but financial stress as well. I won’t go into detail, and I won’t name the business, but I will say I asked for AWD and got FWD....in Vermont. We all know how much snow effects our everyday lives. So just use your imagination. Fast forward two years and two winters of being stuck, terrified to drive, $10,000 upside down and hopeless, I decided to try again. I’ve had my eyes on the new Ford Escapes since the summer. Their sleek and chic look, and not to mention; the AWD for a pretty affordable price? Perfect car in my eyes. I went in yesterday with small hopes. I’ve been turned down by dealerships my own personal friends work at. They wouldn’t touch me because of how upside down I was in value. From the moment I stepped in Faiths Ford (stay with me here, because if you look at my other reviews, you’ll realize, I don’t say great things if I don’t wholeheartedly mean them) Bryce, this young, happy go lucky guy was right there to greet me. I sat down and told him about my situation, and eventually we went for a test drive of my dream car. Almost done, stay with me. From the get go, Bryce was kind, funny and over all, exactly what I needed that day. He worked so hard to find an option that would make me happy while ensuring my safety. 45819486184 hours and one hangry Mari later, the financial adviser Brunell came out to bring me into his office. He realized Bryce and I were complaining about being hungry and took his card out, told Bryce to get lunch for us and brought me in to chat. When I say Brunell was an amazing soul, I mean it. Us millennials stick together and it shows. He sat down and told me what the deal was. He didn’t sugar coat anything. I very understandably was upset that my payment was going to increase so much, but sitting there and talking to Brunell convinced me that I owe it to myself to make myself happy. Who needs Chipotle every week, when it could go towards a payment on your dream car? Easy choice. SO TO END THIS; my experience with Faiths showed me basic human kindness, during a pandemic. Those two really did everything they could to make sure I was happy. I honestly felt listened to, never over stepped, never invalued, worthy and comfortable while making a huge decision. And I can say with 100% confidence, I’d do it all again. So to Bryce and Brunell, and all the other Faith members that helped pull through for me yesterday, thank you. You’d be crazy not to do business with such kind human beings.",False,True,False,False,False

They do promote a sort of free-spirited self-confidence in children and young teens, they get kids away from their phones/ipads/laptops, and when things go well (good counselors, good peer group, good weather) it can be a wonderful experience. On the other hand ... each year the ""identity politics"" gets more and more calcified and all-encompassing. The pressure on kids to conform to the camp's identity-politics ideology is relentless (though, to be fair, this can vary a bit from year to year and from camp to camp). In particular ... I would be very cautious about sending my daughter to F&W nowadays. It's an epicenter of Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria. Many girls this age are (understandably) unhappy about how female persons are treated in society, and are nervous about their upcoming puberty/period/bodily changes. At F&W, there is a lot of peer pressure on these girls to declare themselves transgender, ""non-binary"", or anything else that is Not A Girl. Its a weirdly anti-feminist message. Lots of girls who go to F&W are not into stereotypically ""girly"" things (makeup, dresses). Ideally, the message they would get at F&W is ""That's OK, girls can do and be whatever they want; ignore the stupid stereotypes"". Instead, the message now seems to be ""If you don't fit the stereotype, you might not be a girl. You can be trans, or non-binary, or anything else as long as it isn't a girl."" My older boy saw a bit of this, and from what I'm hearing from the younger one it's gotten worse. I've spoken with three parents of girls who went to F&W camps and when they returned home told their parents that they ""didn't want to be called a girl"". In all three cases they eventually got over their ROGD and eventually became comfortable with their own biology, but in one case the girl spent a year being stressed-out and anxious about what it meant to be ""non-binary"" before she finally decided that she was OK to be female and she didn't need to change. So. Lots of good things about the camps, but all the (well-intentioned) focus on ""identity!"" can be overwhelming and distressing to children ... and some of the counselors seem to think it's their mission to convince as many kids as possible to adopt a new and different and more ""woke"" identity.",False,False,False,False,True

Prior to actual purchase, I was borderline scolded by the sales person because I told them I would use it on a slope (it's self propelled). Their YouTube videos and write-ups take pride and show the ""ease of using self-propelled units on slopes"", and the slopes shown in the videos and photos are far greater than what I have. They would not sell it to me because it won't work on slopes. I was then told by another staffer that I was 'allowed' to purchase the unit without fear of voiding a warranty, and then got an email from someone else that said ""I will void the warranty"". After the sale, they said it is only usable on a 'gentle' slope. 2. The unit arrived well beyond the expected delivery date, but I do not fault DR. They sent it promptly. Variable Speed Drive handle is limp and the cable will not retract nor will it pull back. I have yet to put oil and gas in unit and thought I should call DR first. Which I did. 3. After a total of 3+ hours of holding and listening to their 'Pls hold' message every 30 seconds, I am told that I cannot return the unit and they will send a replacement part for me to install. Or they will arrange someone else to put the part on for me, however will not guarantee how long that will take. I can do it with my eyes closed, but why should I? Further, I am losing more and more valuable time. After telling the call taker that I would like to elevate this concern, he said ""Sure. I will put you on hold."" It is at this point that I resigned myself to the fact that DR has me on the hook, they know it, and there is nothing I can do but allow them to send me the part and I will do the installation. 4. I called later (as though to place an order...thus immediately they answered the phone). Robert (quite nice) offered to take the unit back and replace it, however they are out of this model and there is a long- long lead time. Thus another effort to make it sound like I am getting the deal of the century by getting the part and fixing it myself. When I ordered the unit, it took three minutes to place the order and pay. Thus, once they get your money, it's all over with customer service. Their telephone recordings say "" you have been chosen to take a survey immediately following your telephone call. Push #1 to take the survey"", and I always do. However they immediately disconnect you once your call is over. And I typically wait in excess of 60 seconds just to be sure they disconnected the call. I do not recommend DR / Generac as a result of this situation. Being a former customer of DR Power Equipment who was extremely pleased (it is a great leaf vacuum), I am qualified to state that once they were bought up by Generac, their post-purchase customer service appears to have decayed considerably. I just proved it. So if you buy something from them and it fails (in my case, before it is even assembled), it may be your burden to furnish labor.

He confirmed my diagnosis that it had no reverse gear and needed a new transmission. He ordered the parts and said three deliveries would come as parts for his installation on new date July 2, 2016. He told me one box would be a large, heavy box which would be the transmission and to call in when these arrived. I called in when I received three parts, all small, and no transmission. I called into Sears and told the lady who answered that no transmission had been delivered as stated by the technician on June 18. The lady insisted I had all the parts needed and did not check/confirm with the technician as scheduled for July 2. Sears would not give the technician's name or phone number to alert him to the issue. So he arrives on July 2 and there is no transmission there and I repeat him the issue with Sears Service about all the parts are there. He is ticked. He has to use my phone since there is no cell service and stays on the line for about 30 minutes to get it cleared up and the transmission correctly ordered. I am now rescheduled again for July 12. The transmission arrives a few days before July 12 and again I call it in. The technician arrives and installs the transmission on July 12. So finally it gets installed, at no fault of the technician in over a month since my first call. The technician was excellent! Unfortunately, he had to make three trips to my house over 24 days because Sear Service who answered the phone, transferred me all over the world to people who barely spoke good English and could not and would not report what I told them about the transmission not being there, nor would they let me pass the message on. So customer service on the phone was horrible, whoever sent the parts was horrible, but the actual technician was great. Too bad Sears can't get their back end customer support back in the U.S. where it belongs to RESOLVE ISSUES, rather than just trying to get you off the phone and credit for taking a call.

This is a nice store, clean and easy to get to, displayed well and an attractive showroom. I want to preface I am in the automotive business and have been for 20 plus years. With that, I train dealerships on sales products and understand the mentality of the majority of car dealers: get the customer in. I inquired about a used car I saw online via email. This stores process uses a BDC department (call center) that handles incoming sales calls and internet leads. Typically an inquiry will lead to an “auto responder” message. It simply fills in a template and the BDC agent fills in your name, his name and sends it back with a quick message inserted. It’s simple. My reply was missing several fields, such as the name of the person I was dealing with and other small details. No big deal; BDC agents are not paid much and they answer lots of leads so I was not expecting the red carpet treatment. After the auto reply, I got a phone call telling me the car was still available, it had a clean Auto Check or Carfax, and he invited me to come in. The next morning I showed my wife the car online and we made arrangements to drive up and see it. I called the person who left me a message and told him I could be there at midday. He told me the car was there, he would pull it up front and call me if anything changed as it takes me 40 minutes to get there and my wife took time off work. We arrived and the car was out front. The BDC agent came out to meet us and handed us over to a salesperson. The salesperson asked for our licenses and filled out a worksheet, which was sort of odd as all the information he asked was already on a sheet of paper from the BDC agent. Again, no big deal. So after our brief interview and giving him our licenses, he said he would get the keys and be right out. 5 minutes later he came back and said “sorry but we took a deposit on the car last night and it is being sold right now.” My issue with this is the BDC agent, or someone, had the opportunity to tell me this information beforehand, actually the night before and throughout the day. The internal policy they have is what I mentioned earlier: get the customer in no matter what. Their logic is that it would be easier for them to have this conversation with me while I was in the store in hopes I would just pick another car and not leave. I can tell you that this is not a good way to run a business. Yes, 1 out of maybe 15 people this may work on, but the other 14, I would estimate that at least half would not only not do business with them in the future, but they would also write a review and tell others their experience. If I was told we have a deposit on that car but if it falls through I can let you know, I certainly would be more inclined to consider this store in the future. I spoke with the GSM and explained I was in the business (they typically don’t care) and my frustration with how I was treated. He acknowledged their process is to get the customer in and worry about it when they are there. Prior to the internet and all the information the consumer has access to, I could sort of understand this thinking while not agreeing with it. But in this marketplace and the competiveness within the industry, he who treats the customer the best usually wins. St J Subaru does not share this mindset and because of this, I will not only not buy a car from them in the future, they actually put me off of going there again for the service on my Subaru. I prefer to be treated professionally and have someplace that recognizes my time and business is valuable.",False,False,False,False,True

He told me that they had 2 options. Both well more than my current terms, but I have a growing family and needed more room. I explained that my vehicle is essentially a mobile office. He proceeded to tell me about how this thing is loaded and has everything that I could need. I am not a negotiator so I assumed that this is the only vehicle on the lot that will fit my needs and I needed to get back to work we did the deal. One hour after delivery I realize that this ""loaded"" truck does not have XM radio which I need to run my business from the road. I am frustrated with myself and the salesman for not asking or disclosing this specific detail to me. I assume that I just can't find the XM, so I go on the Shearer website and find the they have about 90 crew cabs on the lot and most of them have XM, and many well below the price of the options I was given. So I call the dealership and leave a message for the salesman. While I am waiting to hear back I receive a generic email from him asking me to give them all great reviews and if I have anything other than great reviews to call them. I called 2 more times over the next day attempting to reach the salesman. on the third day I get another email asking me again to give them great reviews and to call if I had anything other than great things to say.

This really upset me, as at first I was not told that the vehicle didn't have it, then am told that the fix is for me to go buy something else after just purchasing a $53000 truck. Now I decide that I am going over the salesman and going to deal directly with the General Manager who clearly would want to keep my business as this is the 3rd vehicle in 4 years that I have purchased from this dealership totaling roughly $150000 not counting all of the years of service on those vehicles. Apparently the General Manager returns calls just like the sales team. After never hearing back from the GM and growing more angry and frustrated by the day, I finally get a text from the salesman asking my to come in because he has a solution. When I go in his solution is for me to download an app to my phone and use my cell plan data to get XM through my phone. This sends me over the edge. I tell him that if they do not put an XM radio in the vehicle that I will never do business of any kind with Shearer Chevrolet ever again and will tell everyone who asks not to go to this dealership after the way I was treated. The salesman goes inside and calls the GM who tells him that they can install the XM radio which is a $450 job and only charge me $350.

I called the service department to see how much they would charge to ""trigger"" the TPMS (Tire Pressure Monitoring System sensors) on my late-model vehicle (not purchased from here). I called the service department and the lady who answered seemed okay at first. She had no open appointments today, but said I could come in next Monday at 2 PM. I told her I'm starting a new job on Monday and asked her what the service department's hours were, and she immediately got very rude, saying ""the hours of the service department are very different from the available appointment times"".

She said she'd make me an appointment for 2 PM, and I explained to her again that I don't think I can make that, and she said to call and cancel if I couldn't. This is where it gets worse... I asked her if she knew roughly how much it'd cost, and she said, ""well, it'll be about the same as reprogramming a key... so $50 for the service, plus we charge $90/hr for labor, and it will take about 30 minutes"". WHAT? $95? The tool to trigger the sensors costs $75 on Amazon, and it literally takes 5 minutes. You put the car into the training mode (easily done using the DIC buttons), and hold the tool next to the tire, press a button, and the horn chirps. Repeat the process for the other 3 wheels. A 4 year old could do it. I explained to the lady and she became very agitated, saying that this was the cost of the service and that was that. I told her no thanks and that I'm not interested. I understand that dealerships need to make money, but her attitude was an immediate turn-off. My car had other service needs, I was hoping the dealership would just take care of the TPMS sensors as a courtesy, but forget it. $95 for a 5-minute job that requires no ""labor"" other than walking around the car is just asinine. I'll buy the tool myself so I'm not paying $95 every time I switch my tires (which I do myself). If you want my advice, stay far away from this dealership.

The Service Repair Shop did not notify me of an estimate of costs. Nevertheless, they proceeded to work on the A/C, without my consent.

His story did not convince me in the least, as my phone had been on that day. Giving him the benefit of the doubt, he never tried to place a second phone call, which suggests some very suspicious activity on Shea Motors' part. One alleged call sufficed in their customer service department. It was left up to me, the paying consumer, to get in touch with them. I never succeeded in reaching the service technician via telephone; his secretary gave me the okay to come down and claim my car. The $200 odd-bill was completely excessive: $140 for labor, $70 for parts. I strongly recommend that one avoid Shea Motors in Middlebury, VT at all costs.

To any one that is considering taking his or her automobile to Shea Motors, think it over twice. Only later on did I discover another Google review about Shea Motors, which contained many of the same negative experiences: no notification whatsoever on Shea Motors' behalf, shady business/customer service practices, etc. In summation, take your automobile to a different garage. The Service Department will feed you every excuse in the book to make up for their numerous faults.

While visiting the area, we used their services to board our dog while skiing on a Saturday and Sunday at Sugarbush. Saturday was a great experience – our dog was walked and care for wonderfully. However, on Sunday we coordinated a morning drop off and when we returned 5 hours later, found our dog had not been check-in on, had his pen area tightened because a gate came loose, and had been sitting in his poop during the visit because he wasn’t taken for a walk. Evidently the Boarding team only visits the pets at 8:30am and 4:30pm on Sundays. The team at Mad River Vet & Boarding was responsive the next day when we called to find out what happened but hearing a “we told you this on the phone”… nothing in writing or on the website was very disheartening and gaslighting. Advertising “first rate care” and only visiting animals twice with an 8 hour span in between doesn’t match. It’s also worth noting that there was no “boarding” number to call, so we left a message confirming drop off with the main line, which appears to be ignored on Sundays. For this group to say that “your pets’ health and well-being are very important to [their] whole team and [they] take every possible measure to give your animals the care they deserve”, I hope serious consideration goes into how weekend boarding is treated moving forward.",False,False,False,False,True

I'd like to thank him for dealing with my dramatic reactions in stride. You, sir, are a titan. There's a bit of a story here so buckle up (haha car puns): I got my car state inspected at midas 7/24/19. I was concerned about the tires, and my state inspection was due in a couple months so I though ""hey, i'll just do it all in one go"" cause scheduling around work is a bit nightmarish for me. I passed the inspection with flying colors aside from the tires, which I expected of course. No problem. I scheduled an appointment to have new winter tires stuck on 9/7/19. Everything worked out. BUT THEN, About a week later that Thursday, the oil light came on and there was some... substance... leaking from the under part of the car. I freaked out a little since I just had the oil changed 7/3/19 and so I called Midas. They werent open, so I left a message saying I'm just gonna drop it in the parking lot and I'll be there right when they open the next morning to have it looked at. I wanted to limit driving as much as possible. Used my partner's car to get to work. When I got to Midas on friday I told them the issue and they said they would look at it over the weekend. It was labor day weekend so I was totally comfortable picking it up tuesday. I was going camping in NH anyways! I got a call saturday from a tech, I believe it was Mark, who told me that he didn't find anything. He said the oil light was on and asked me if it was on when i dropped it off and I said yes. He said it's probably just a malfunction with the light because the oil level was fine and there were no leaks. I was relieved and they sent me home saying it really was nothing and implied that I overreacted. That's fair. I'm always a little paranoid about my car. It happens. I drove around in it all week, oil light blinking all the way. I figured I'd make a plan to fix that after the tires get replaced. My appointment for tires was finally here this past weekend! And LO AN BEHOLD! They put my car up on the lifter thingy and it WAS leaking after all. AND the oil levels were OVERFILLED. Hoo Boy. I wasn't mad. I just wanted some answers. How did this happen? Overfilled? How did extra oil manifest in my tank after I had it changed 7/3. I took action as soon as I noticed the oil light was on and I was sent home to drive with it like that..... I was also sent NO pictures of any of the inspection work they did that weekend.... Big Yikes, Midas. BUT LUCKILY! There was no damage to the engine. Darrin priced me out for a new oil switch and an oil change. On TOP of the new tires and tire change ($425). $585. I admit I misunderstood the price at first and thought it was $585 + $425 = $1010 and I REALLY had a panic attack. Sorry Darrin. I mean it. Then he explained that it was gonna be $585 TOTAL. Okay I can live with that!!! He even gave me a bit of a discount after the fact for my troubles of being jerked around the past week. With the tire disposal fee, I paid $535 total out the door. tires+tire change+oil change+oil switch and all the work. Pretty good I think!!

The first girl that greeted us came back to us and said that they closed at 8pm and they didn't have any tables available and that we should leave and come back at 7:30 and maybe we might get seated. Yes she said ""MAYBE."" It was 7:10 pm at this point and there were at least 5 - 7 tables available. Who says that??? Why tell us we should leave and come back in 20 minutes???

I asked to speak to my service assistant because I was told I would be able to bring the car once the part was in. I was transferred to my service assistant and left another message. Another 4 business days go by and I haven't heard anything. I called again and was bounced around to a few different people and the ""best"" they could do was still a week and a half out. By the time I bring my car in again I'll have been driving around with this broken part in my car for over a month, with Burlington Subaru making zero effort to own and fix their mistake. They have been treating me in manner which screams ""don't bother us, we don't care about your business nor our quality of work."" In addition to this terrible customer service, how can I ever trust this service center again when they FORGOT to put a screw in. What if it was a critical component? What if I found out by means of a crash rather than pushing a button on my dash?",False,False,False,False,True

We recently went to rent skis for our children on a Friday and were helped by a friendly staff who recommended we rent for 1 day since the weather was iffy for our second day of skiing and that we should keep an eye on the weather and return their skis by 8:00 PM the following day if we decided to only ski the one day.

My husband asked to speak to a manager and they called the owner. When my husband explained the situation to the owner, he said that their policy was clearly stated on the paperwork but when he told him that his workers told us 8:00 PM his comment was that he knew this because he was there when they said it!!! He also said that even though they closed early at 7:00, it would have given us an hour grace period to return the skis. My husband explained to him that we have shopped at this store many times in the past but with this experience he would not be seeing his face again.

So instead of having 2 functional sets of wheels, I now have my winter tires on my OEM wheels and my summer tire not mounted at all. I checked the bill to see what the service writer had requested and they had correctly interpreted my instructions. So I figured it was just an honest mistake made by the tire tech and I could pretty easily have it corrected. I called them a few times in the next couple days trying to get through to them and left a message that they didn't follow up on. When I finally did get them on the phone they were initially very understanding and said that they would correct the mistake but that they were very busy at the time and they were hesitant to schedule an appointment since they were so backed up. I figured since at least had my snow tires on that I could wait a couple months and schedule something then. Ever since then they have either not answered the phone or said they were too backed up to schedule an appointment. Most recently I called and explained the whole story again and then asked when I could schedule an appointment, they said they really weren’t taking any new appointments and said “it sounds like you might want to call around to some other shops”. No... I wanted you guys to correct your mistake and I shouldn’t have to beg and yell for you to fix it. I’ll never take my car there again and I would never recommend them to anyone. Mistakes happen but it is how you handle them that shows your true nature.",False,False,False,False,True

They talked us into an extended warranty on a used Honda, with the caveat that if we did not use it before it expired, we were eligible for a full refund of the $2300+ cost. After jumping through all of the hoops to get the refund, the dealer told us ""I've never heard of such a thing""!!! Yet, we have the original contract that EXPLICITLY STATES the whole process and promises. Now, the dealer is refusing to give us the refund we are owed, instead telling us he will give us $2000 off if we buy another car!! Are you kidding me??? Why on earth would ANYONE buy another car from these dishonest people just to get SCREWED again?? Well guess what Mr Freedom Nissan owner, i guess we'll just have to see you in court with our official warranty contract in hand, THAT WAS SIGNED BY YOUR REPRESENTATIVE.

After calling the dealership directly and navigating through their excruciating phone system and directory, I finally reached Amber Kaplan (notice the last name, it’s the same as the president of Freedom Nissan…there’s a clue to the rest of this story). She pleasantly took my information and promised to call me back “within an hour”. Well guess what…after 8 days without a response I had to call her again and I left a message to call me. I did the same thing on days 9 and 10. Finally, today she called and basically said ”There is nothing we can do for you; it’s out of our hands”. And then had the audacity to say that THEY were in the same boat as WE are! Excuse me, YOU aren’t out $2,250, WE ARE. Well I beg to disagree with that response. There IS something they can do, but they just WON’T because of greed and indifference to their customers needs. Don't tell me that a car dealership can't afford $2250, they made much more than that on the original $30K sale (plus the $2250 warranty).

He said they were issuing a $700 credit. 10 weeks has passed since and nothing. So, it appears he only called to troll me for writing the negative review. ""Store manager"" John Burke, instead of trolling your previous customers and surfing the internet during work hours maybe train your employees, oversee things at the store, and provide a respectable service. My wife and I went into this location last November to ask about the FirstNet program. We were met by Alissa. She told us a bit about the program. My concern was that we were Verizon customers and had bought new phones within the past 6 months and had a payoff of $1,000 still left on them. She told us that if we signed up with AT&T and traded in our phones with them we would both get $700 each over 30 months, which would pay off our phones. We were also told as new customers with AT&T we would qualify for new phones with them and receive the reduced rates of $5 and $4 per month for each phone. Great deal I thought. Then she added if you do autopay your bill would also be reduced by $10 per month. Even better. I asked for copies of all deals we would receive. She took our Verizon phones, submitted the paperwork for the trade in reimbursements, then issued the new AT&T phones. She said you will see the credits applied on your accounts over the next 2 billing cycles. We paid off the Verizon phones, which was $1,076. After 3 cycles we received notice from AT&T that we were not eligible for the trade in credit. We called AT&T and they said we had to address the issue with the store as you can't ""piggy back"" offers. Something I knew nothing about. I called the store and talked to Alissa. She asked for some info, to include my account password so she could go into my account. She then said she would call me back. After a week and no call back we went into the store and asked for the manager. We were greeted by Todd who refused to get a manger and asked to assist himself. After 20 minutes of explanation with him he finally requested a manger. We were finally allowed to speak with John Burke - Retail Store Manager. At first we explained what we were told by Alissa when signing up and what had happened. He defended his employee, of course, stating she's been doing this awhile I cant believe she wouldn't know how it works. We then showed all receipts, paperwork we received and a deeper explanation was given to him. Specifically if we weren't entitled to the trade in why did she apply for them. She applied from the store. We didn't. The final confirming point was when he called her over and told her what happened and she once again stated yes we are entitled to all that she offered and why weren't we getting the promo's and trade ins. At that point John the manager dismissed her and was at a loss for words. I said you see she just said the exact same thing again. All he could do was say I believe you now, but what can I do. I'm just a store manager. I asked that he give us what was offered or at least a part of it. He said it wasn't up to him and would have to run it up the chain to his superiors and that he would call us on Monday with an answer, that was on a Saturday. A week went by with no response. I called left a voice message on his personal cellphone. He did not reply. I called a week later, left a message and received no reply. After 2 months, numerous calls and messages he has not replied.

I certainly am not stupid or inexperienced when it comes to vehicles. I now get my oil changed by the dealership out of pure convenience and as a luxury because I no longer have to save every penny. The last time I was in was Monday, 3/19/2019. While changing my oil, I was told my wipers needed to be changed ( I knew this, my next stop was going to be autozone buy some and do it, but the price was inexpensive at Upper Valley so I agreed to it. Let me make it clear my rear windshield wiper was still clearing, minus a small section where the rubber had fallen off. On the 21st of March in the morning, there was pollen/dirt on the back so I sprayed it and the windshield wiper completely went over the window, did not touch it all. So, I went in and told them about it and was told there was not enough pressure from the windshield wiper due to corrosion on the arm. I obviously found it extremely hard to believe that was the case and listed off 2 other possibilities and stated ""prior to my coming in on Monday, there was contact made to the windshield and now magically there is no contact, corrosion was not identified on Monday.. also my Honda has 83 k ish miles on it.. I find that hard to believe."" So after attempting to speak to another manager ( of course in a meeting) I am suppose to go in on 3/22 at 2pm to speak to the manager, which I now longer have to do. I went out, as I should have in the first place and took a better look it, and one of the speculations I listed to the advisor was apparent, the arm was bent up, I simply bent it back. and magic it clears! So in all, I don't appreciate being called a liar or taken as someone who is an idiot about cars. I do my research, I buy Hondas and Toyotas ( and have had then for 10+ yrs.. no corrosion, ever anywhere). This is the second oil change I have had with an extremely long wait and very poor overall service. Again, I don't appreciate being called a liar and attempted to being taken for a ride. If anyone knows, the arms for the wipers are hardly cheap , so why try to tell me sell me something that I don't need and pass blame on not changing something as simple as wiper",False,False,False,False,True

AND much much emptier by 1130. WHY? Three out of its four main lifts were ""on hold"" The Gondola, Sunny, and Sensation, never opened. Effectively cutting off more than half of the skiable acres. Management will likely say it was for our safety, as a light freezing drizzle was falling. However, being a former lift operator there under previous ownership, those lifts operated under much much more adverse conditions. Heck, its an east coast winter... ice is the norm. Wind was our biggest concern and winds were light today. I fear the other lifts were closed to save payroll (may not be fact, but it sure looked like it).

After renting skis online (I now live in the Rockies) and ordering from the Demo center, I arrive there, confirmred with staff that the Demo Center was still at the base of the quad to pick up rentals, and walked there only to find a message in the window... Closed on Tues/Wed until further notice. Back to Mansfield base where staff apologized for sending me there and off to Spruce center (a long way away) for a limited selection of Demos. The demo center had to be closed for cost reasons, in my opinion. STOWE (or is it Vail?).. The snow is great. The trails are in great shape. You are a destination resort.

The food really is delicious. But my most recent experience with the staff was not as nice, so unfortunately for that reason alone I am giving it 3 stars. I'd love to some how just let the general managers know of what happened, so this is the best way for me to inform them. So last night I ordered take out, Cajun Shrimp Entree and the Millionaires Baked Potato. The lady on the telephone said my Entree comes with a salad, she asked, would you like the House Salad, Ceasar Salad or the Cobb Salad. So I asked her what the last one was, so she started describing it and said it came with bacon, I immediately said yes because who doesn't like bacon on their salad?? So when I got to the restaurant to pick up my order, I left with a small take out bag. I thought it seemed small but just gave it the benefit of the doubt. I then dove all the way home (25 minutes) and realized when I got home that the Cobb salad I was supposed to get wasn't in the bag. Then I got my phone to call and realized the restaurant left a message. A manager named Trevor called and told me the ""house salad"" was at the restaurant still. He was very nice about it. So I called him back and he made sure I would be able to pick up a new one the next day. (At this point I didn't know there was a difference between the House salad and the Cobb salad, I thought he just meant the salad that came with my meal, the Cobb I was expecting). Anyways to make a long story short... I called around 3 today like I said I would, and asked for a manager. The lady that answered the phone (Emily) said she was a manager. So I explained the situation, that the girl the night before told me I would get a Cobb salad with my meal but it was never in the bag. So Trevor said I could get it tomorrow. No matter how much I tried to explain that the girl said I would get a Cobb salad, Emily refused to give me one, she said I was never charged for a Cobb salad and that they don't come with entrees, but I was supposed to just get a small House salad.... That is not the point, if you already mess up an order by not giving someone a salad when they are supposed to, don't give them the wrong salad even if they weren't charged for it! If that's what they ordered, then give it to them... And to top it off, she never even said ""have a nice day"" to me and just whisked me away when I came to pick up the house sale, which, looks pretty pitiful... I am pretty disappointed with how it was handled. Because I really wanted that Cobb salad I thought I was supposed to get! I'm sorry, I know it's just a salad, but it still means something.",False,False,False,False,True

So I drove my car into the bay and I’m told everything will be done and to look out for a text for a estimated price. 11:30 rolls around that day and I still have yet to receive anything so I text the number and I was told my vehicle has NOT been touched because of walk in tire exchanges... now I know for a fact anywhere else the scheduled appointments are always first in line. I get told it isn’t under his control that one guy is the one who calls the shots. I’m irritated at this point and the guy knew it so he decides to offer me a loaner vehicle that they DIDNT have available... well that just put the icing on top so as I’m struggling to figure out what I am going to do I was offered by my mother to use a vehicle of hers for the time being. So I get to the dealership and I tell him that and to keep my car so that it can be looked at when he gets a chance because he said to me he was the one specifically going to be working on my car... well the next day rolls around and I get a text message with a video from some random guy in the shop telling me my car needs this needs that needs this and that... so my level of frustration goes up... I specifically told this guy I wanted 3 things done to it. And when they quoted me the price of 2800$ Not including tax and not including the 120$ diagnostic fee that NOBODY decided to tell me about KNOWING that I was a first timer here! So that put a cherry on top of the icing.... I asked to speak to a manager I get told they spoke to one and they cut the fee in half for me... that’s not what I had asked... I asked again to speak to a manager face to face when I pick up my vehicle because I don’t want them touching my car at this point! I get told ok I’ll let him know. Then I get told that there’s always been a fee for diagnostic... well if only that were mentioned to me the 4 times they had the chance too twice in person and twice through text! Plus I went in telling them what I WANTED done and in that case there shouldn’t have been any diagnostic happening it should’ve been accepted and taken care of and if anything else were to happen or they see something while fixing then tell the customer.

My boys fries were cold and we live 10 minutes away and when we got home and I opened them one only had 3 of the 4 piece nugget we ordered. I then had a 5 year old and a 3 year old arguing and upset because I do not get it that often for them. I called they told me they would replace the order at my next visit, I went to do so 2 days later and only to be told they could not do so!! Ugh. Another instance, just this Saturday evening my fiance and I felt like a late night snack and I drove to Manchester at 11:20 pm arrived at 11:30 (the drive thru is open until 12am Friday & Saturday) to sit at the speaker and have no one answer, I drove around d front got out walled around knocking on the doors and also calling the store several times to only have the employees hiding in the store.

They don't except reservations for lunch and there's almost always a wait... if it's really busy, they are forced to stop taking names for the wait list. Multiple times I've had to wait 30-60 minutes for a table but no complaints from me; I'll gladly wait.
